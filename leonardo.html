	Leonardo DaVinci was very interested in the Flower of Life and studied its form and 
	mathematical properties. floweroflife2He was also interested in how the Flower of 
	Life connected to physical reality as well as consciousness. Leonardo drew the 
	Flower of Life itself, as well as the Seed of Life. Leonardo was known for using 
	the Golden Ratio of Phi in his artwork, this is also known as the Fibonacci Spiral.
	Which is derived from the Flower of Life pattern. I am sure many of you have heard
	of The Fibonacci Spiral before, the Fibonacci Spiral  is the series of numbers 0,1,1,
	2,3,5,8,13,21,34â€¦ each number is comprised by adding together the previous 2 numbers.
	This is important because the spiral that this mathematical equation makes can be
	found in all living things including human beings, plants, animals and even our
	galaxy, The Milky Way.<a href="https://www.learnit.nl" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
