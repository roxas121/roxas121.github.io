	<h1>The Temple of Osiris at Abydos</h1>

	The Temple of Osiris at Abydos, Egypt contains the oldest known examples of 
	the Flower of Life. They are at least over 6,000 years old and may date back 
	to as long ago as 10,500 B.C. or earlier. It appears that it had not been 
	carved into the granite and instead may have been burned into the granite 
	or somehow drawn on it with incredible precision. Other examples can be found
	in Phoenician, Assyrian, Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern, and medieval art.
	A rather interesting depiction of the flower of life is found in The
	Forbidden City, in Beijing, China. The Flower of Life is found in a spherical
	form underneath the paw of the “Fu-Dog,” or more accurately known as the
	“Guardian Lion.” This palace was home to 24 emperors of the Ming and Qing
	dynasties. The Fu-Dogs were a symbol of protection and also, they were
	considered to be the guardians of knowledge. Which is interesting when you
	consider the spherical Flower of Life symbol that is found under the dog’s
	paws. The dogs are literally guarding the knowledge.
