	The "Flower of Life" can be found in all major religions of the world.
	It contains the patterns of creation as they emerged from the "Great Void".
	Everything is made from the Creator's thought. After the creation of the Seed
	of Life the same vortex's motion was continued, creating the next structure
	known as the Egg of Life. This structure forms the basis for music, as the
	distances between the spheres is identical to the distances between the
	tones and the half tones in music. It is also identical to the cellular
	structure of the third embryonic division (The first cell divides into two
	cells, then to four cells then to eight). Thus this same structure as it
	is further developed, creates the human body and all of the energy systems
	including the ones used to create the Merkaba. If we continue creating more
	and more spheres we will end up with the structure called the Flower of Life.
